# Template YAML Course Outline

# The course key word is the only required item in order to generate a slide deck
course: Sample Course Title

# The chapters key word defines a list of all the chapter titles that will be generated for this deck
chapters:
  # The title of chapter one is the key for the set of objects below.
  - chapter1-title:
    # Under a chapter the notes key word may be used to define the notes for that specific page -- this will be validated as a markdown file with no unicode text.
    notes: |
      Markdown notes for the chapter slide can be placed here. The pipe character will tell YAML to retain the blocks formating style as well.

      That way the empty line above stays an empty line when we import it into the powerpoint slide deck.

      This section could also be a link to a file if that makes organization nice.

      When this section is parsed it will be checked to ensrure it only contains ASCII characters!
    # Under a chapter the subchapters key word defines a list of all the subchapters within the scope of the current chapter
    subchapters: 1
      # The title of the subchapter is the key for the set of objects below
      - subchapter1-title:
        # Under a subchapter the slides key word dfines a list of all the slides under the scope of the current subchapter
        slides:
          # The title of the slide is the key for the specific slide title
          - slide1-title:
            # Under a slide the type key word is not required but does allow for the type of slide to be identified
            type: title|bullet|blank
            # Under a slide the visable keyword allows the slide to either be visable or none visable on the powerpoint deck
            visable: (Not a required field but optional) -- true or false
            # Under a slide the notes section is a markdown section that is used on the notes object
            notes: |
              Markdown notes for this slide. Again run through the same parser to ensrue it complies with the standards expected.
          - slide2-title:
          - slide3-title:
